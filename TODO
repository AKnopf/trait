= TODO
* Make only lambda resolves possible
    * with reference to original versions
* make basic functionality work! now.
* incorporation options :only and :except
* Maybe use a builder pattern for creating incorporations?
* What about a method in a trait, that needs a block?


= ideas
* Define "part state"  - a trait that handles instance variables.
  So the class does not need to implement all the getters and setters manually
