= TODO
* test renaming when conflict is between Traitable and Trait
* test composition of traits
* more patterns for builder


= ideas
* Define "part state"  - a trait that handles instance variables.
  So the class does not need to implement all the getters and setters manually
* Patterns for resolves: (manual lambda does not count as pattern any longer)
    * method(symbol) - calling the in-class-defined-method instead
    * call_in_order
    * inject
    * pick_one
